          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Potato salad is the first food I remember eating, so I really do
            have a deep emotional attachment, but every so often, I crave
            something completely different—and this Armenian-style potato salad
            is completely different. And completely delicious. Serve drizzled
            with more olive oil and garnished with more fresh mint.

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Transfer sliced potatoes into a large pot with enough cold water
              to cover the potatoes by a couple of inches. Stir in 1 rounded
              tablespoon kosher salt and 2 ½ teaspoons dried mint. Bring to a
              boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and let cook until
              tender, about 15 minutes, checking every 5 to 6 minutes for
              doneness. Drain well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl and let cool
              slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              While potatoes cool, heat ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet over
              medium-high heat. Add red onion, red bell pepper, garlic, and a
              pinch of salt; cook and stir for just 1 minute. Turn off the heat
              and stir in remaining dried mint.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drizzle freshly squeezed lemon juice into potatoes and toss gently
              with a spatula. Add green onions, red onion mixture, remaining
              olive oil, fresh mint, fresh parsley, salt to taste, black pepper,
              chili flakes, and cayenne. Mix with a spatula until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and flavors
              have melded, 3 to 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unwrap; stir, taste, and adjust seasonings as needed to personal
              tastes. The salad almost always needs more salt stirred in once
              it's tasted after being chilled. Serve.
            </li>
          </ol>
